### What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps deploy and manage applications more efficiently. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications using reusable and configurable templates called Helm charts. 

A Helm chart is a collection of YAML templates and configurations that define a Kubernetes application.
